        <p>Moving on from Premise, as there are better premise page that get updated regularly.</p>
        <p>This prompt/premise was originally ported for my friends but since I'm not into those kind of stuff, so I don't update them nor taking care of the page layout.</p>
        <p>It'd be better for me to take down this prompt for good as it's not even equal to those on Neocities.</p>
        <p>You still can check out some other projects I made in the <a href="/">homepage</a>.</p>
        <p>This page will soon deleted when I got the chance to rewrite this GitHub Page of mine.</p>
