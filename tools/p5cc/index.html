    <h2>Persona 5 Calling Card Maker</h2>

    <h2>Announcement</h2>
    <p>Sorry for inconvinient, but P5CC version 2 needs to be shut down as I couldn't maintain it anymore.</p>
    <p>Worry not, P5CC v3 is online and you can visit it at <a href="https://skyventuree.github.io/p5cc/">skyventuree.github.io/p5cc</a></p>

    <hr>
    <h3>Regarding the API</h3>
    <p>You can still use the API (https://rouxkarlus.pythonanywhere.com/p5cc/api) to generate cards before May 1st 2022.</p>
    <p>However, after this date, the card will be replaced with an announcement to move to P5CCv3. All the generated card on the database will also get deleted.</p>
    <p>If you want to use the version 2 of this tool after that date, you can grab its source code here:</p>
